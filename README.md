# Virtual-Assistant-JARVIS

# .env File
We need this .env file to store some private data such as API Keys, Passwords, and so on that are related to the project. In this project, let's store the name of the user and the botname like:
      USER=Mohit
      BOTNAME=JARVIS

To use the contents from the .env file, we'll install another module called python-decouple as "pip install python-decouple"
